### Overview
Organized by the **Barcelona Declaration’s Working Group on Replacing Closed Systems (WG4)** and the **[Helmholtz Open Science Office](https://os.helmholtz.de/en/)**, this webinar showcases four institutional journeys from Europe and Latin America that **use (or are moving toward) open, non-proprietary systems for open research information**.

Speakers will explain why they signed the Barcelona Declaration; how they use or are moving to open, non-proprietary systems; the governance considerations and technical steps taken; and the challenges and benefits. These cases offer practical pathways and actionable insights for institutions considering similar transformations.

**Date**: Thursday, 4 December 2025.

By bringing together institutions at different stages, this session underscores that there is no single path to openness. We look forward to seeing you and continuing the conversation on how to make research information openly available in practice.
