{{<picture_click "An infographic explaining the scope, characteristics and benefits of open research information. On the left a closed circle represents research information. Two arrows point to the right labelled Free to Use and Free from restrictions on reuse. They point to an open circle labelled Open Research Information. Below, Research Information is explained as including bibliographic metadata, metadata on research, software, research data, samples and instruments, information on funding and grants, and information on research organisations and contributors. Open Research Information is motivated by a desire to move towards full transparency in assessments, towards inclusive data for equitable decision making, and towards monitoring and incentivising open science using open data." >}}
